# Malware-Analysis-Projects-for-Beginners

## Static Analysis of a Simple Malware Sample

Objective: Understand the basics of static analysis by examining a known malware sample without executing it.
Tasks: Extract strings, analyze the PE header, study the imports and exports, and identify any embedded resources.

## Dynamic Analysis in a Controlled Environment

Objective: Learn how to safely execute and monitor malware in a virtual machine to observe its behavior.
Tasks: Set up a sandbox environment, use tools like Process Monitor, Wireshark, and RegShot to monitor system changes and network activity, and create a detailed report on the malware's actions.

## Analyzing a Ransomware Sample

Objective: Understand the inner workings of ransomware, including its encryption mechanisms and ransom note delivery.
Tasks: Identify the encryption algorithm used, analyze the code responsible for file encryption, and determine how the ransomware communicates with its command-and-control server.

## Behavioral Analysis of a Keylogger

Objective: Study how a keylogger operates and records keystrokes.
Tasks: Capture the keylogger's process using tools like Procmon, identify how it logs keystrokes and where it stores the captured data, and explore any evasion techniques it uses.

## Network Traffic Analysis of a Trojan

Objective: Analyze the network traffic generated by a Trojan to understand its communication patterns and potential data exfiltration.
Tasks: Execute the Trojan in a controlled environment, use Wireshark to capture network traffic, identify the protocols used, decode any communication, and map out the command-and-control infrastructure.
